# DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

Following the common project called the [cloud resume challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) I created my portfolio using a variety of technologies. I had fun doing this project and had a few struggles along the way. I was able to learn new skills and show them here.
